What is a branch? How do they work? 
It is a place where you experiment and can do mistakes so that if you want to revert them you go back to the root 



Ammend commit -> to change the description or something else of a previous commit 

Revert commit -> to remove one of the previous commits 




Repo -> store your source code, maintain history and keep track of branches 

Push -> from the laptop (local file system) to the cloud (GitHub) 

Pull -> from the cloud to the laptop 


Allows you 1.  to keep a commit history and reverse mistake, 2. collaborate with more people, and 3. do isolate development in branches
