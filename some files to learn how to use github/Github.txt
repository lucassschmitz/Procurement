GitHub desktop 

What is a branch? How do they work? 
It is a place where you experiment and can do mistakes so that if you want to revert them you go back to the root. 
You have to change the branch and then commit stuff. 



Ammend commit -> to change the description or something else of a previous commit 

Revert commit -> to remove one of the previous commits 


Fork -> when you take someone's else repo and create a copy for yourself. E.g I forked a copy of the Juliia Quant Econ repository. 

Repo -> store your source code, maintain history and keep track of branches 

Push -> from the laptop (local file system) to the cloud (GitHub) 

Pull -> from the cloud to the laptop 


Allows you 1.  to keep a commit history and reverse mistake, 2. collaborate with more people, and 3. do isolate development in branches 



####### Questions #######
1. currently the Quantecon Julia repository appears on GitHub desktop but when I go online is not in my repos. What is the problem? 

The mistake was that I had not pushed it into GitHub 

2. I would like to have one folder that is on my documents where I keep all the GitHub repositories. How to do it?
